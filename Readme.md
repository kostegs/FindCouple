#Find Couple

This is a prototype of the game "Find Couple", where player has to find pairs of the cards (among closed cards), select them and open. If the player is right he'll get scores. This release was created by using SFML-library (not original, but changed in order to make it easier).

The Game probably will be improved, If I have time for it )))

P.S. The mechanisms with cards was developed by using two-dimensional arrays, because it was a task on my study-course. I'd prefer do it using classes, If I could.
